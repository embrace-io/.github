# Welcome to Embrace!

[Embrace](https://embrace.io/) is observability for a mobile world. Our instrumentation and insights allow you to move beyond mere monitoring, and identify the issues that affect your app.

## Embrace's Commitment to Open

Embrace has fully open-sourced its mobile software development kits. The available SDKs are for [the Apple ecosystem](https://github.com/embrace-io/embrace-apple-sdk), [Android](https://github.com/embrace-io/embrace-android-sdk), [React Native](https://github.com/embrace-io/embrace-react-native-sdk), [Flutter](https://github.com/embrace-io/embrace-flutter-sdk), and [Unity](https://github.com/embrace-io/embrace-unity-sdk). Pull down the code, try out the instrumentation, and contribute if there's a capability you'd like to see.

Additionally, as Embrace is a mobile-focused member of the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://www.cncf.io) and an [OpenTelemetry Vendor](https://opentelemetry.io/ecosystem/vendors/), each mobile SDK is building towards full compliance with and extension of [OpenTelemetry's key signals](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/signals/). Presently, the iOS and Android SDKs have fully-exportable traces and logs built into their feature sets.

Embrace's mobile SDKs are each published under the [Apache 2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) license.
