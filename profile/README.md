# Welcome to Embrace!

[Embrace](https://embrace.io/) is observability for a user-centric world. Our instrumentation and insights allow you to move beyond mere monitoring, and identify the issues that affect your apps.

## Embrace's Commitment to Open

Embrace has fully open-sourced its mobile and web software development kits. The available mobile SDKs are for [the Apple ecosystem](https://github.com/embrace-io/embrace-apple-sdk), [Android](https://github.com/embrace-io/embrace-android-sdk), [React Native](https://github.com/embrace-io/embrace-react-native-sdk), [Flutter](https://github.com/embrace-io/embrace-flutter-sdk), and [Unity](https://github.com/embrace-io/embrace-unity-sdk). Additionally, our [Web SDK](https://github.com/embrace-io/embrace-web-sdk) provides in-depth telemetry for web apps. Pull down the code, try out the instrumentation, and contribute if there's a capability you'd like to see.

Embrace is a user-obsessed member of the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://www.cncf.io) and an [OpenTelemetry Vendor](https://opentelemetry.io/ecosystem/vendors/). Each SDK is built with [OpenTelemetry's key signals](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/signals/) as the basis for its telemetry. Presently, the iOS, Android, Web, and React Native SDKs have fully-exportable traces and logs built into their feature sets.

Additionally, Embrace is working to make Kotlin a first-class language in the OpenTelemetry ecosystem, to better-support mobile and web engineers working on Android and [Kotlin Multiplatform](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/multiplatform.html). The first step is a currently-experimental [Kotlin API](https://github.com/embrace-io/opentelemetry-kotlin) that binds the existing OpenTelemetry-Java SDK. The API provides tracing and logging APIs and can be used in Android and JVM-based projects by providing it with an instance of the Java OTel SDK.

Embrace's open-source SDKs are each published under the [Apache 2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) license.
